This blog contains notes I make as I learn Linux. For a long time, I have been a software developer using Microsoft technologies, so the notes here will be from the perspective of a Windows user attempting to learn Linux seriously for the first time.

The motivation for learning Linux is to be able to build cloud-native applications.
