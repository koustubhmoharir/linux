## Getting started with WSL

Windows users can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) using these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment) from Microsoft. As of WSL 2, this installs a real Linux kernel in a low-overhead virtual machine. The Windows filesystem is mounted under `/mnt` on Linux and the Linux filesystem is available as a network share at `\\wsl$` on Windows.

By default the Ubuntu distribution is installed. More information about Ubuntu on WSL can be found [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL). This includes some information about running graphical applications using an X Window server.


## Useful configuration

Go to Windows Terminal > Settings  
To start the Linux terminal in the Linux home directory instead of Windows profile folder, set the Starting Directory under Windows Profiles > Ubuntu to /home/username.  
To prevent Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V from interfering with Linux applications, go to Actions and delete the shortcuts. Ctrl + Shift + C and Ctrl + Shift + V will still work.
