## What is fzf?

fzf is a general purpose interactive fuzzy finder that works on the command line. It can be integrated with the shell and with vim. The primary use case is to select items from files, directories, commands, or any other lists easily. Without such a tool, navigating and switching between the filesystem or opening files is a laborious task.
