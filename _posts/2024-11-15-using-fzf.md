## What is fzf?

fzf is a general purpose interactive fuzzy finder that works on the command line. It can be integrated with the shell and with vim. The primary use case is to select items from files, directories, commands, or any other lists easily. Without such a tool, navigating and switching between the filesystem or opening files is a laborious task.

## Shell integration

Pressing `Ctrl+t` launches an interactive finder that shows files and directories under the current directory. Typing in the finder filters the list. Enter puts the selected item at the cursor. Esc cancels the filter. Arrow keys or `Ctrl+p` and `Ctrl+n` can be used for navigation. The customization of fzf [described earlier in this guide](_posts/2024-11-16-improving-usability.md) adds `Ctrl+f` and `Ctrl+d` options to filter the list to show only files or only directories.

Pressing `Alt+c` launches an interactive finder that shows directories only. Enter performs a cd to the directory. This can be used to switch to a directory very quickly.

Pressing `Ctrl+r` opens the finder with the command history.

fzf also offers completions for various commands. These can be triggered by typing ** and pressing Tab.
